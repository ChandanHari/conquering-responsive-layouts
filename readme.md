> Site should be responsive

## Day 01 | Using percentages & avoiding heights

### Percentages vs fixed widths

- By default things are responsive (default is 100%)
- Working in percentages for width will make life easier.

### Percentages on the child

- Percentages on the child are relative to its parent.

### Why its a good idea to avoid heights

- Naturally websites are responsive.
- We have done something to css that make it unresponsive, try to fix it.
- Avoid heights
  - Use padding to get extra space.
  - Use responsive units (em, rem).

## Day 2 | Getting familiar with relative units

## Day 3 | Enter max-width

### Adding in a max-width

- Setting a max-width prevents the text from going across on big sized screens.
