# Conquering Responsive Layouts

## Day 01 Using percentages & avoiding heights

### Percentages vs fixed widths

- By default things are responsive (default is 100%)
- Working in percentages for width will make life easier.

### Percentages on the child

- Percentages on the child are relative to its parent.

### Why it's a good idea to avoid heights

- Naturally websites are responsive.
- We have done something to css that make it unresponsive, try to fix it.
- Avoid heights
  - Use padding to get extra space.
  - Use responsive units (em, rem).
